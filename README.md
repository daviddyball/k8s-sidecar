# What?

This is a docker container intended to run inside a kubernetes cluster to collect config maps with a specified label and store the included files in an local folder. It can also send a html request to a specified URL after a configmap change. The main target is to be run as a sidecar container to supply an application with information from the cluster. The contained python script is working with the Kubernetes API 1.10

# Why?

Currently (April 2018) there is no simple way to hand files in configmaps to a service and keep them updated during runtime.

# How?

Run the container created by this repo together you application in an single pod with a shared volume. Specify which label should be monitored and where the files should be stored.
By adding additional env variables the container can send a html request to specified URL.

# Features

- Extract files from config maps
- Filter based on label
- Update/Delete on change of configmap
- Decode base64 data from within a configmap

# Usage

Example for a simple deployment can be found in `example.yaml`. Depending on the cluster setup you have to grant yourself admin rights first: `kubectl create clusterrolebinding cluster-admin-binding   --clusterrole cluster-admin   --user $(gcloud config get-value account)`

If the filename ends with `.url` suffix, the content will be processed as an URL the target file will be downloaded and used as the content file.

If the filename ends with `.base64` suffix, the content will be base64 decoded and persisted to disk.
